### Introduction:
In this project our team worked on a dataset about the disaster of the titanic, in order to find some type of relation between different features of the dataset.
We specially looked for a relation between features as sex, age, class of cabin, number of siblings or spouses aboard and surived or not.
Simone Robresco and Francesco Torterolo programmed the code to analyse the data and to create the comparisons and the graphics.
Beatrice Risso conceived which type of graphs to use.
Luca Grosso created the notebook and the github repository and customized the site.
